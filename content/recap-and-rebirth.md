So the eagle-eyed observer will note that this blog does not contain many posts. If you examine the dates of the birth of my web presence, you may note that some big changes were about to happen in the world due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Even without world-shaking public health crises, personal crises in my immediate and extended family were also the theme of 2020: a death, a breast cancer, and a miscarriage all ocurred in that calendar year. With a heavy negative cognitive load, many of my grand ambitions were abandoned.

That brings us to now. What's new with me is that I have become a victim of economic uncertainty and a pull-back in investment. My job is no more, and so I have a new impetus to revive my web presence and the time to do so.

Over the next fews weeks I plan to write a few pieces on my philosophy toward my chosen field: computer vision (and robotics), highlight some fun personal coding projects, and showcase some hardware stuff I've worked on but long-deferred actually completing.

Beyond my immediate aim of showcasing my skills, I do hope that long-term I can contribute in my own nanoscopic way to fostering a culture of humanity in tech. That's probably worthy of its own post and I don't even have the words to fully describe what I mean yet, but here is a part: I want to push back on the centralization and enshittification of the internet. If I want to see interesting stuff on the web that isn't inherently shilling something, then I should be willing to create and host my own content.
