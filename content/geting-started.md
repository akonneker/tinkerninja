Greetings, internet denizens. I have intended to put up a public web presence for some time for a variety of reasons. I am intending for this space to be a sort of project log for the things I want to make, whether they be hardware or software, music, art, and maybe some attempts at useful technology.

Since we're still fairly early in the year, it seemed like a good time to go ahead and complete a pseudo-resolution. The current motivating factor that has spurred me on is the fact that I hope this log of project notes will encourage me to be more focused in my hobby efforts. I'm also a believer in the principles of open source hardware and software, and I would like things that I learn to be useful to other people.

I'm going to kick things off witha  series of posts titled: *learning machine learning with entirely too many MNIST digits*, which is a nod to the great [Learning Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/). This series of posts will be my opinionated (read: *naive and ill-informed*) take on some of the current ML frameworks, and we'll be covering the following topics: 
* Convolutional Neural Nets
* Multilayer Perceptrons 
* Probabilistic Graphical Models 
* etc.

with the following frameworks:

* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* and other esoteric things like [Juice](https://github.com/spearow/juice)

The main test problem will be MNIST digit classification, because of course it will.


These posts won't necessarily be coming out in any set timeframe or order, and I reserve the right to talk about anything I want in between posts in the series. 

TTFN.
